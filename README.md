### Project Motivation:
Improving the interface for [dango](https://github.com/gsobell/dango), with estimated score and move validation would involve implementing selected game logic. This is the outgrowth of dango, with hope of being integrated back it at a later date, when both are functional.

### Project Blueprint:
* `GTP` compatible I/O
* Basic game logic
* Basic joseki (openings)
* Game status estimation
* Use interpolation to make game heatmap

goma is already better than most humans (most humans don't know how to play go)
